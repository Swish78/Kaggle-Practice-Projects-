It specifies the number of miles the car can travel on one gallon of fuel.\n* 'cylinders': This column represents the number of cylinders in the automobile's engine. It indicates the power and performance capabilities of the engine.\n* 'displacement': This column represents the engine displacement, which is the total volume swept by all the pistons inside the cylinders during one complete cycle. It is typically measured in cubic centimeters (cc) or liters (L).\n* 'horsepower': This column represents the horsepower rating of the automobile's engine. Horsepower is a unit of power that measures the rate at which work is done.\n* 'weight': This column represents the weight of the automobile, typically measured in pounds (lbs) or kilograms (kg). It indicates the mass of the vehicle.\n* 'acceleration': This column represents the acceleration performance of the automobile, measured in seconds. It indicates how quickly the car can go from 0 to 60 mph or another standard acceleration metric.\n* 'model_year': This column represents the year of the automobile model. It indicates the manufacturing year of the vehicle.\n* 'origin': This column represents the origin or manufacturing country of the automobile.
