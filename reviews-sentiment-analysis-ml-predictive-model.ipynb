The goal of this project is to predict the sentiment expressed in the reviews and gain valuable insights into customer perceptions.\n\nWith a vast dataset obtained from Kaggle, encompassing a diverse range of customer feedback, I delve into the world of sentiment analysis. By dividing the dataset into training and test sets, I ensure the accurate evaluation of my sentiment analysis model's performance.\n\nEmploying the SVC algorithm, I train the model on the labeled training data, enabling it to learn and make sentiment predictions based on the review features. Through vectorization techniques, I convert the textual data into numerical representations suitable for the SVC algorithm, allowing for effective sentiment analysis.\n\nTo enhance usability, I develop a function that takes user-input reviews and provides real-time sentiment predictions using the trained SVC model. This functionality empowers businesses, including McDonald's, to gain valuable insights into customer sentiments and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction.\n\nBy merging sentiment analysis, machine learning, and a vast dataset of McDonald's store reviews, this notebook aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer perceptions. It equips businesses with the tools to analyze sentiments effectively and improve their offerings based on customer feedback.</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://m.economictimes.com/thumb/msid-71699011,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4,imgsize-250370/mcd-bccl.jpg\" alt=\"Heat beating\" style=\"height:366px;margin-top:3rem;\"> </div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Sentiment Analysis:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p>In the sentiment analysis section, I imported the dataset and examined its columns, head, sample records, and information to gain a better understanding of the data.
